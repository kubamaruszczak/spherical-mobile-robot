## Spherical mobile robot project

The control system of the robot as well as remote control are based on an AVR ATmega328P microcontrollers. <\br> <\br>

The project integrates:
- PWM control of motors,
- reading values from encoders, accelerometer and gyroscope,
- implementation of complementary filter,
- PID controller,
- remote control using a joystick and two radio modules,
- serial communication using I2C and SPI interfaces,
- monitoring of Li-Po battery voltage.
